to do 
1) fix balls so when one is lifted by the user it lifts those to the leeft/right of it 
2) responsiveness 
3) fix if you hit a link how it messes up the cradle
4) maximum angle that the balls can go up 
5) pause when the user exits the screen 
6) z score of 'drag the spheres into any formation' needs to be lower so it is behind the gray boxes when they expand
