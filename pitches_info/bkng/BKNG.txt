During 2023 Booking rode strong travel recovery in Europe & China to 25% rev growth and 53% EPS growth and the stock increased 76% in the year. However, in Q4 management released lower than expected guidance, suggesting a normalization in the travel industry away from artificially high double digit ‘Covid recovery’ growth towards normalized LT high single-digit growth. Despite management sounding confident in BKNG’s 2024 outlook relative to 2023s monster year, they guided 8% topline and 14% earnings growth, leading to a downward revision in consensus EPS by 2% for FY’24 and 3% for FY’25. The stock dropped after this guidance and is down about 4% from February high. 

This guidance of hsd gross bookings and topline growth is similar to pre-Covid growth in 2019 and 2018 of 8% and 11% respectively. However, BKNG has numerous tailwinds working in its favor today that it didn't have pre-Covid which suggest that this guidance in line with historicals is conservative. Average Daily Rate of bookings is growing 4% YoY today vs. flat in 2018-19 and flights bookings have increased 400% since 2019 with 33% 3Y CAGR. There is also additional room for Covid recovery in Asia and Europe where tourism has not fully bounced back to pre-Covid levels. 

Based on my analysis, I believe that BKNG can achieve gross bookings rev growth of 13% in 2024 which is a 5% delta vs consensus estimates in line with guidance of 8%. This puts it closer to Expedia’s top line guidance of 10% growth and Airbnb’s 12%-14%. I anticipate an upward revision for BKNG as it achieves this growth over the next three quarters. Its Price / Fwd 2024 Earnings is currently around 21 compared to ABNB's 37, so I would expect its Price / Fwd Earnings to increase to mid-20s. Please email for excel model & dcf if interested.
